#  Exam

## General AWS Exam Technique

- 25% easy Q’s
- 50% medium Q’s
- 25% hard Q’s

### Phases

> Consider it three phases
>
- **Phase 1:** Easy questions. Do these first.
- **Phase 2:** Whatever questions is left, go through. Identify hard questions and mark these for later.
- **Phase 3:** In remaining time focus on remaining hard questions. Depending on time, focus or guess.

### Exam Technique

- If it’s your first exam, **assume you will run out of time**
- The way to succeed is to be **efficient**
- 2 minutes to read Q, Answers and make a decision
- **Don’t guess until the end** - later questions may remind you of something **important from earlier**
- Use the **mark for review!!** ❗
- Take **ALL** the practice tests you can
- aim for **90%+** before you do the real exam

## Question Technique
> *If you follow a set, logical process of identifying the key elements of questions, removing word fluff (duplicated irrelevant wording) and identifying any self-eliminating answers you can reduce your cognitive load in the exam, and improve your accurate questions per minute rate.*
>
- Questions are **1-2 lines of preamble (scenario)**
- Then the **question** itself
- **4-5 answers - multi choice** or **multi-select**
- At the associate level - generally answer is simple **right** and **wrong**
- Occasionally **“most suitable”** from some right answers
- There are generally 1 or 2 answers which can be **excluded**
- **locate those first**
- Most questions have an overall **criteria** or **restriction**
- **Cost** effective
- **Best Practice** Security - Do what AWS want you to do - EC2 instance role to give access
- Highest **Performance**
- Direct-connect > Site-to-site VPN
- **Timeframe**
- Try and **eliminate any crazy answers**
- Find **what matters** in the question
- Highlight and remove any **question fluff**
- Identify what **matters** in the **answers**
- Eliminate any bad answers now you’ve read the question
- Ideally - what remains is correct
- worst case, quickly select between what remains
- **DON’T PANIC - mark for review and come back later**
