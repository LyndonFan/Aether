#  Serverless and Application Services

## Architecture Deep Dive

### Monolith

- All in one instance
- Bad
- Prone to error

### Tiered Architecture

- Can be running on different HW, but still tightly coupled
- Can vertically scale individually
- Can have internal LB between them so we can scale each tier horizontally
- Bad because tiers are still coupled
- Each tier has to be running something for app to function

### Evolving with Queues

> System that accepts messages
>
- Queue-based decoupled architecture
- Queues decouple two tiers
- Async communication
- ASG based on Queue Length
- E.g. numbers of videos to process

### Microservice Architecture

![Untitled](img/Untitled%20123.png)

### Event Driven Architecture

- **No constant running** or waiting for things
- **Producers** generate events when something happens
- clicks, error, criteria met, uploads, actions
- Events are delivered to **consumers** with **event router**
- **actions are taken** and the system returns to waiting
- Mature event-driven architecture **only consumes resources while handling events** (serverless)

![Untitled](img/Untitled%20124.png)

## AWS Lambda

- Function-as-a-Service (**FaaS) -** short running & focused
- Lambda **function** - a **piece of code** lambda runs
- Functions use a **runtime** (e.g. Python 3.8)
- Functions are loaded and run in a **runtime environment**
- The environment has a **direct memory** (**indirect CPU) allocation**
- You are billed for the **duration that a function runs**
- A key part of **serverless** architectures
- **Stateless** - brand new env each time
- **900s (15 min) function timeout**

> *Exam tip: Docker - not lambda*
>

### Common Uses

> *Common architectures*
>
- **Serverless applications** (S3, API Gateway, Lambda)
- File processing (S3, S3 Events, Lambda)
- Database Triggers **(DynamoDB, Streams, Lambda)**
- **Serverless CRON** (EventBridge/CWEvents + Lambda)
- Realtime Stream data Processing (Kinesis + Lambda)



### Public Lambda Architecture

- **By default** lambda function are given public networking. They can access **public AWS services** and the **public internet**

![Untitled](img/Untitled%20126.png)

### Private Lambda Architecture

![Untitled](img/Untitled%20127.png)

### Security

- Resource policies can only be changed via CLI or API

![Untitled](img/Untitled%20128.png)

### Logging

- Lambda uses **CloudWatch, CloudWatch Logs & X-Ray**
- Logs from **Lambda executions** - CloudWatchLogs
- **Metrics** - invocation success/failure, retries, latency… stored in **CloudWatch**
- Lambda can be integrated with **X-Ray** for **distributed tracing**
- CloudWatch Logs requires **permissions via Execution Role**



## Invocation

> Three types: Synchronous, asynchronous and Event Source mappings
>

### Synchronous

- **Handle errors or retries on client-side**

![Untitled](img/Untitled%20129.png)

### Asynchronous

![Untitled](img/Untitled%20130.png)

### Event Source Mapping

![Untitled](img/Untitled%20131.png)

### Versions

- Lambda have versions - v1, v2, v3
- A version is the **code** + the **configuration** of the lambda function
- Its **immutable** it never changes once published & has its own **Amazon Resource Name (ARN)**
- **$Latest** points at the latest version
- **Aliases** (DEV, STAGE, PROD) point at a version - **can be changed**

### Startup Times

![Untitled](img/Untitled%20132.png)

## CloudWatchEvents and EventBridge

> *CloudWatch Events and EventBridge have visibility over events generated by supported AWS services within an account.*
>
>
> *They can monitor the default account event bus - and pattern match events flowing through and deliver these events to multiple targets.*
>
> *They are also the source of scheduled events which can perform certain actions at certain times of day, days of the week, or multiple combinations of both - using the Unix CRON time expression format. Both services are one way how event driven architectures can be implemented within AWS.*
>

💡 **EventBridge** is replacing **CloudWatchEvents**


### Key Concepts

- If X happens, or at Y time(s), do Z
- EventBridge is sort of CloudWatch Events v2
- **Use EventBridge!**
- A **default** Event bus for the account
- In CloudWatch Events this is the only bus (**implicit)**
- **EventBridge can have additional busses**
- Rules match incoming events (or schedules)
- Schedules sort of like CRON jobs
- Route the events to **1+ Targets**, e.g. Lambda

### EventBridge / CloudWatch Events

## Serverless Architecture

> *The Serverless architecture is a evolution/combination of other popular architectures such as event-driven and microservices.*
>
>
> *It aims to use 3rd party services where possible and FAAS products for any on-demand computing needs.*
>
> *Using a serverless architecture means little to no base costs for an environment - and any cost incurred during operations scale in a way with matches the incoming load.*
>
> *Serverless starts to feature more and more on the AWS exams - so its a critical architecture to understand.*
>

### What is serverless

- Serverless isn’t one single thing
- Software architecture
- You manage few, if any servers - low overhead
- Applications are a collection of small & specialized functions
- **Stateless** and **Ephemeral** environments - duration billing
- **Event-driven** - consumption only when being used
- **FaaS** is used where possible for compute functionality
- **Managed services** are used where possible

### Serverless Architecture Example

![Untitled](img/Untitled%20134.png)

## Simple Notification Service (SNS)

> *The Simple Notification Service or SNS .. is a PUB SUB style notification system which is used within AWS products and services but can also form an essential part of serverless, event-driven and traditional application architectures.*
>
>
> *Publishers send messages to TOPICS*
>
> *Subscribers receive messages SENT to TOPICS.*
>
> *SNS supports a wide variety of subscriber types including other AWS services such as LAMBDA and SQS.*
>
- **Public AWS Service** - network connectivity with Public Endpoint
- Coordinates the sending and delivery of **messages**
- Messages are ≤ **256 KB payloads**
- **SNS Topics** are the base entity of SNS - **permissions and configuration**
- A **Publisher** sends messages to a **TOPIC**
- **TOPICS** have **Subscribers** which **receive** messages
- e.g. HTTP(S), Emails(-JSON), SQS, Mobile Push, SMS Messages & Lambda
- SNS used across AWS for notifications - e.g. CloudWatch and CloudFormation
- **Delivery Status** (including HTTP, Lambda, SQS)
- **Delivery Retries** - Reliable Delivery
- **HA** and **Scalable** (Region)
- Server Side Encryption (**SSE**)
- Cross-Account via **TOPIC Policy**

## Step Functions

> *Step functions is a product which lets you build long running serverless workflow based applications within AWS which integrate with many AWS services.*
>

### Some problems with Lambda (Limitations)

- Lambda is FaaS
- Never put a full application inside lambda (15 min timeout)
- Lambda can be chained together - gets messy at scale
- Runtime Environments are **stateless**

### State Machines

- Serverless workflow: **Start → States → End**
- States are **THINGS** which occur
- Maximum Duration **1 year**
- **Standard Workflow** and **Express Workflow**
- Started via API Gateway, IOT Rules, EventBridge, Lambda …
- Amazon States Language (**ASL)** - JSON Template
- **IAM Role** is used for permissions

### States

- **SUCCED & FAIL**
- **WAIT**
- Period of time or to specific time
- CHOICE
- PARALLEL
- MAP
- TASK (Lambda, Batch, DynamoDB, ECS, SNS, SQS, Glue, SageMaker, EMR, Step Functions)

![Untitled](img/Untitled%20136.png)

## API Gateway

> *API Gateway is a managed service from AWS which allows the creation of API Endpoints, Resources & Methods.*
>
>
> *The API gateway integrates with other AWS services - and can even access some without the need for dedicated compute.*
>
> *It serves as a core component of many serverless architectures using Lambda as event-driven and on-demand backing for methods.*
>
> *It can also connect to legacy monolithic applications and act as a stable API endpoint during an evolution from a monolith to microservices and potentially through to serverless.*
>

### Refresher

- Create and manage APIs
- Endpoint/entry-point for applications
- Sits between applications & integrations (services)
- Highly available, scalable, handles authorization, throttling, caching, CORS, transformations, OpenAPI spec, direct integration and much more
- Can connect to services/endpoints in AWS or on-premises
- HTTP APIs, REST APIs and Websocket API

### OVERVIEW

![Untitled](img/Untitled%20137.png)

### Authentication

![Untitled](img/Untitled%20138.png)

### Endpoint Types

- **Edge-Optimized:** Routed to the nearest CloudFront POP
- **Regional**: Clients in the same region
- **Private:** Endpoint only accessible within a VPC via interface endpoint

### Stages

![Untitled](img/Untitled%20139.png)

### Errors

💡 **Remember these!**


- **4XX - Client Error** - Invalid request on **client** side
- **5XX - Server Error** - Valid request, **backend issue**
- **400** - Bad Request - Generic
- **403 -** Access Denied - Authrorizer denies… WAF Filtered
- **429** - API Gateway can throttle - this means you’ve exceeded that amount
- **502** - Bad Gateway Exception - bad output returned by lambda
- **503 -** Service Unavailable - backing endpoint offline? Major service issues
- **504** - Integration Failure/Timeout - 29 s limit

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/api/CommonErrors.html

### Caching

- TTL Default 300 seconds (min 0, max 3600)
- Can be encrypted

![Untitled](img/Untitled%20140.png)

## Simple Queue Service (SQS)

> *SQS queues are a managed message queue service in AWS which help to decouple application components, allow Asynchronous messaging or the implementation of worker pools.*
>
- Public, fully managed, highly-available queues - **Standard or FIFO**
- **Standard** = **at-least-one**
- **FIFO = exactly-once**
- FIFO Performance: 3000 messages per second with batching, or up to 300 messages per seconds without
- Billed on “requests”
- 1 request = 1-10 messages up to 256KB total
- **Short** (immediate) vs **Long** (**waitTimeSeconds)** Polling
- Encryption at rest (**KMS)** & in-transit
- Messages up to **256KB** in size - **link** to large data
- Received messages are **hidden (VisibilityTimeout)**
- then either reappear (retry) or are explicitly deleted
- **Dead-Letter Queues** can be used for problem messages
- ASGs can scale and Lambdas invoke based on queue length
- Queue policy
- Like resource policy
- ❗Default 4 days, max 14 days ❗

![Untitled](img/Untitled%20141.png)

## SQS Standard vs FIFO

### FIFO

- Single Lane Highway
- 300 TPS w/o Batching
- 3000 TPS with batching
- Exactly once processing
- Duplicates are removed
- Message order is **strictly** preserved

### Standard

- Multi Lane Highway
- Scalable, as wide as required
- Near unlimited TPS
- Best-effort ordering, no rigid preservation of message order
- At least once delivery, can be more than one copy of a message
- Decoupling, worker pools, batch for future processing
-

## SQS Delay Queues

> *Delay queues provide an initial period of invisibility for messages. Predefine periods can ensure that processing of messages doesn't begin until this period has expired.*
>

![Untitled](img/Untitled%20142.png)

## SQS Dead-Letter Queues

> *Dead letter queues allow for messages which are causing repeated processing errors to be moved into a dead letter queue in this queue, different processing methods, diagnostic methods or logging methods can be used to identity message faults*
>

## Amazon Kinesis Data Streams

> *Kinesis data streams are a streaming service within AWS designed to ingest large quantities of data and allow access to that data for consumers.*
>
>
> *Kinesis is ideal for dashboards and large scale real time analytics needs.*
>
> *Kinesis data firehose allows the long term persistent storage of kinesis data onto services like S3*
>
- Kinesis is a **scalable streaming** service
- Producers **send** data into a kinesis **stream**
- Streams can scale from low to near infinite data rates
- Public service & highly available by design
- Streams store a **24-hour** moving window of data
- can be increased to a maximum of **365 days** (additional cost)
- Multiple consumers access data from that moving window

![Untitled](img/Untitled%20144.png)


### SQS vs Kinesis

- Ingestion of data - Kinesis
- Else: SQS
- SQS 1 production group, 1 consumption group
- **SQS:** Decoupling and Async communication
- **SQS:** No persistence of messages, no window
- **Kinesis:** Designed for **huge scale ingestion, multiple consumers and rolling window**
- **Kinesis:** Data ingestion, analytics, monitoring, app click

## Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose

> *Kinesis Data Firehose is a stream based delivery service capable of delivering high throughput streaming data to supported destinations in near realtime.*
>
>
> *Its a member of the kinesis family and for the PRO level exam it's critical to have a good understanding of how it functions in isolation and how it integrates with AWS products and services.*
>
- **Fully managed** service to load data for **data lakes,** **data stores** and analytics services
- **Automatic scaling** - fully serverless, resilient
- **Near Real Time** delivery (~60 seconds)
- Supports **transformation** of data on the fly (Lambda)
- **Billing - volume** through firehose
- Can deliver data to: Redshift, ElasticSearch, Destination Bucket, Splunk
- Can be integrated with Kinesis Data Stream
- When? E.g. when you want to store data from a data stream past the rolling window

- Integrates with other AWS services e.e.g **Rekognition** and **Connect**

![Untitled](img/Untitled%20147.png)

## Amazon Cognito - User and Identity Pools

> *A user pool is a user directory in Amazon Cognito. With a user pool, your users can sign in to your web or mobile app through Amazon Cognito. Your users can also sign in through social identity providers like Google, Facebook, Amazon, or Apple, and through SAML identity providers. Whether your users sign in directly or through a third party, all members of the user pool have a directory profile that you can access through a Software Development Kit (SDK).*
>
>
> *Amazon Cognito identity pools (federated identities) enable you to create unique identities for your users and federate them with identity providers. With an identity pool, you can obtain temporary, limited-privilege AWS credentials to access other AWS services.*
>
- Cognito has terrible naming
- **Authentication, authorization and user management** for web/mobile apps
- Two parts of Cognito: User Pools an identity pools
- **USER POOLS:** **Sign-in** and get a JSON Web Token **(JWT)**
- User directory management and profiles, sign-up and sign-in (customizable web UI), MFA and other security features
- **IDENTITY POOLS:** Allow you to offer access to **Temporary AWS Credentials**
- **Unauthenticated Identities:** Guest Users
- **Federated Identities:** SWAP -  Google, Facebook, Twitter, SAML2.0 & User Pool for short term AWS Credentials to access AWS Resources
- Identity pools assume an IAM role

## AWS Glue

> *AWS Glue is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that makes it easy for customers to prepare and load their data for analytics. You can create and run an ETL job with a few clicks in the AWS Management Console. You simply point AWS Glue to your data stored on AWS, and AWS Glue discovers your data and stores the associated metadata (e.g. table definition and schema) in the AWS Glue Data Catalog. Once cataloged, your data is immediately searchable, queryable, and available for ETL.*
>
- Serverless ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
- vs data pipeline (which can do ETL) and users servers (EMR)
- Moves and transforms data between source and destination
- **Crawls** data sources and generates the **AWS Glue Data catalog**
- Data source**: Stores**: S3, RDS, JDBC Compatible and DynamoDB
- Data source: **Streams:** Kinesis Data Stream & Apache Kafka
- Data **Targets:** S3, RDS, JDBC Databases

### Data Catalog

- **Persistent metadata** about data sources in region
- **One catalog** per region per accont
- **Avoids data silos**
- Amazon Athena, Redshift Spectrum, EMR & AWS Lake Formation all use Data Catalog
- configure **crawlers** for data sources

### AWS Glue

## Amazon MQ

> *AmazonMQ is an AWS implementation of Apache ActiveMQ*
>
>
> *It supports open standards such as JMS, AMQP, MQTT, OpenWire and STOMP*
>
> *If you need to support any of these, and use queues and topics - AmazonMQ is the tool to use.*
>
- SNS and SWS are AWS Services - using AWS APIs
- SNS provides TOPICS and SQS provides QUEUES
- Public services - highly scalable - AWS integrated
- Many ORGS already use topics and queues and want to migrate into AWS
- SNS and SQS won’t work out of the box
- We need a **standards compliant** solution for migration

### MQ

- **NOT A PUBLIC SERVICE - you need a private network connection between on-prem**
- Open-source message broker
- Based on Managed Apache ActiveMQ
- JMS API - protocols such as AMQP, MQTT, OpenWire and STOMP
- Provides QUEUES and TOPICS
- One-to-one or one-to-many
- **Single instance** (test, dev, cheap) or HA Pair (Active/standby)
- VPC Based - Not a public service - Private networking required
- No AWS native integration - delivers activeMQ product which you manage

![Untitled](img/Untitled%20152.png)

- SNS or SQS for most **new** implementations (default)
- SNS or SQS if AWS integration is required (logging, permissions encryptions, service integration)
- MQ if you need to migrate from an existing system with little to no application change
- MQ if APIs such as JMS or protocols such as AMQP, MQTT, OpenWite and STOMP are needed
- **Remember you ned private networking for MQ**

## Amazon AppFlow

> *Amazon AppFlow is a fully managed integration service that enables you to securely transfer data between Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications like Salesforce, SAP, Zendesk, Slack, and ServiceNow, and AWS services like Amazon S3 and Amazon Redshift, in just a few clicks. With AppFlow, you can run data flows at enterprise scale at the frequency you choose - on a schedule, in response to a business event, or on demand. You can configure data transformation capabilities like filtering and validation to generate rich, ready-to-use data as part of the flow itself, without additional steps. AppFlow automatically encrypts data in motion, and allows users to restrict data from flowing over the public Internet for SaaS applications that are integrated with AWS PrivateLink, reducing exposure to security threats.*
>
- Fully-managed **integration** service
- Exchange data between applications (connectors) using flows
- Syns data across applications
- Aggregate data from different sources
- Public endpoints, but works with PrivateLink (privacy)
- AppFlow Custom Connector SDK (build your own)
- E.g.
- Contact records from Salesforce → Redshift
- Support Tickets from Zendesk → S3
