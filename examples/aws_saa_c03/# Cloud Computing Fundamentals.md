# Cloud Computing Fundamentals

## Essential Characteristics of Cloud Computing

ðŸ’¡ **On demand self-service:** A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.
*Can provision capabilities as needed without requiring human interaction.*

`Provision and terminate using a UI/CLI without human interaction.`

**Broad network access:** Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).
*Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms.*

`Access services over any networks, on any devices, using standard protocols and methods.`

**Resource pooling:** The providerâ€™s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. There is a sense of location independence in that the customer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction (e.g., country, state, or datacenter). Examples of resources include storage, processing, memory, and network bandwidth.
*There is a sense of **location independence**â€¦ no **control** or **knowledge** over the exact **location** of the resources. Resources are **pooled** to serve multiple consumers using a **multi-tenant model**.*

`Economies of scale, cheaper service.`

**Rapid elasticity:** Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases
automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the
consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can
be appropriated in any quantity at any time.
*Capabilities can be **elastically provisioned** and **released** to scale **rapidly** outward and inward with demand. To the consumers, the capabilities available for provisioning ofter **appear** to be **unlimited**.*

`Scale UP (OUT) and DOWN (IN) automatically in response to system load.`

**Measured service:** Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.
*Resource usage can be **monitored, controlled, reported** and **BILLED**.*

`Usage is measured. Pay for what you consume.`


## Public vs Private vs Hybrid vs Multi Cloud

ðŸ’¡ **Public cloud:** AWS, Azure, Google. Meet the essential characteristics of cloud computing.

**Multi-cloud:** Using more than one of the public cloud platforms.

**Private cloud:** Run on business premises. AWS Outpost, Azure Stack, Anthos.

**Hybrid cloud:** Using **private** cloud and **public** cloud in cooperation as a single environment.


## Cloud Service Models

> ***X** **a**s **a** **S**ervice*
>

**Infrastructure Stack**

- Application
- Data
- Runtime
- Container
- OS
- Virtualization
- Servers
- Facilities

Parts **you** manage, parts managed by the **vendor**.

Unit of consumption is what makes each service model different - application vs OS

**XaaS Services**

**On-Premises**

- Application
- Data
- Runtime
- Container
- OS
- Virtualization
- Servers
- Infrastructure
- Facilities

**DC Hosted**

- Application
- Data
- Runtime
- Container
- OS
- Virtualization
- Servers
- Infrastructure
- ~~Facilities~~

*Data centre*

**IaaS**

- Application
- Data
- Runtime
- Container
- **OS**
- ~~Virtualization~~
- ~~Servers~~
- ~~Infrastructure~~
- ~~Facilities~~

*EC2 uses the IaaS service model*

**PaaS**

- Application
- Data
- **Runtime**
- ~~Container~~
- ~~OS~~
- ~~Virtualization~~
- ~~Servers~~
- ~~Infrastructure~~
- ~~Facilities~~

*Heroku is a PaaS*

**SaaS**

- **Application**
- ~~Data~~
- ~~Runtime~~
- ~~Container~~
- ~~OS~~
- ~~Virtualization~~
- ~~Servers~~
- ~~Infrastructure~~
- ~~Facilities~~

*Netflix, Dropbox, Office 365 etc.*

++ Faas, CaaS, DBaaS



## ðŸ—£YAML - *YAML Ain't Markup Language*

> Human readable data serialization language.
A YAML document is an unordered collection of key:value pairs, each key has a value.
YAML support strings, integers, floats, booleans, lists, dictionary.
>

```yaml
cats: ["ben", "bin", "ban"]
# Same list can also be represented as below. Indentation matters.
cats:
- "ben"
- "bin"
- ban # values can be enclosed in "", '' or not - all valid but enclosing can be more precise

cats:
- name: ben
color: [black, white]
- name: bin
color: "mixed"
- name: ban
color: "white"
numofeyes: 1

Resources:
s3bucket:
Type: "AWS::S3::Bucket"
